2. Know how to install Python- you can use this link to download Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Know how to start coding Python- type "python" in the VS code terminal.

    - how to run Python code files in Jupyter Notebooks (did not discuss in class)

1. Understand some basics about debugging (did not discuss in class)


## 2. Goal: Capstone Checklist Points


The homework for Week 1 will focus strictly on Capstone planning.

Please refer to the Syllabus for Capstone requirements.

- If you have not done so, create an account for yourself on www.github.com (name should be professional)

- Create your `activities`, `homework`, and `capstone` repos on GitHub, and clone them down to your local environment inside your `/code/savvycoders/` folder.

- Inside your Capstone repo you might want to create a `documents` folder for all your project documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs. (It could be useful to create a separate images folder to collect images for your project.)


## Steps for Submitting the Week 1 Homework:

1.  Complete the Week 1 Homework

1.  Run the git commands as discussed in class, using git status before and after each command to make sure your files are correctly prepared to be pushed to GitHub!

    The commands are:

    `git status`

    > **Note:** _Unstaged Files are red and files that are staged are green._

    `git add .`

    `git status`

    > **Note:** _Your files should be stage and show up green now!_

    `git commit -m  "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`

    `git push`

    > **Note:** _Remember what we talked about in
    > regards to trying to push a branch that has not been created remotely. It may return as an **ERROR!!!** Read the message it returns as it tells you what command to run most of the time to resolve the no upstream branch error._

1.  Go to your Homework repository on GitHub

1. Copy the URL of that page this should look something like:

    [https://github.com/yourUserName/Homework](https://github.com/yourUserName/Homework)

<br>

### Markdown Language Homework:

- Watch this video to learn more about Markdown: [Markdown Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo)


### Git & GitHub Homework:

- Create 3 repos online -- `Homework`, `Activities`, `Capstone`
- Clone these 3 repos down to you local machine inside of your `savvycoders` folder

- In your homework repo online on GitHub, click the Green Button that says `Add a README`
- Delete all of the text currently populating the page
- In the README file write your name in a large font
- Write some sub-heading about yourself in a smaller font
- Create a list that explains your goals for this Data Analytics course
- Add and name a web link in your readme file, for any Python coding article you found interesting
- Add an image that you feel inspires you for this cohort
- Write a short paragraph explaining something about your image

When done commit the new file by clicking the green `Commit new file` button.

Remember to `pull down` these changes to your homework repo on your local machine

<br>

- Use  `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push` to upload your homework changes to GitHub in the cloud

<br>

### Jira Homework:

- Create a Jira ticket with your Homework Repo URL to notify us your homework is ready for review

- Here is the link to that Jira board where you should create the ticket... <https://scfsteam1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SDAP/boards/94>


## When done with homework

When homework has been completed, do the following...
